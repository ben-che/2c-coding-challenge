### Instructions for running the project

I bootstrapped the project with TypeScript CRA, so setup should be relatively straightforward!

1. `cd` into the project root
2. `npm i` to install dependencies
3. `npm start` to run the project; it will be available on `localhost:3000`

If the above instructions don't work, let me know and I can transfer the code into a CodeSandbox!

### Notes:

- I didn't see any Tablet styles on the Figma file and the jump from 390px to 1440px is pretty big, so I tried my best to make up some styles in between that would still make the UI look good
